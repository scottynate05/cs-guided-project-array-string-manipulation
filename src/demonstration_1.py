"""
Given an array of integers `nums`, define a function that returns the "pivot" index of the array.

The "pivot" index is where the sum of all the numbers on the left of that index is equal to the sum of all the numbers on the right of that index.

If the input array does not have a "pivot" index, then the function should return `-1`. If there are more than one "pivot" indexes, then you should return the left-most "pivot" index.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The sum of the numbers to the left of index 3 (1 + 7 + 3 = 11) is equal to the sum of numbers to the right of index 3 (5 + 6 = 11).
Also, 3 is the first index where this occurs.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.

    # Set a totals to the sum of all nums
    totals = sum(nums)
    # set up a left totals to zero
    left_totals = 0
    # iterate over nums extracting num and index
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        # check if our left totals are equal to        
        # (totals = left totals - num)
        if left_totals == (totals - left_totals - num):
            # return index to caller
            return index
        # increment our left totals by num
        left_totals += num

    # return -1 to the caller
